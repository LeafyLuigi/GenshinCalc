# GenshinCalc
 
**(2023-12-19 "update") I've been without motivation for this project for quite some time now. I'm considering dropping everything and either starting anew or otherwise rebuilding it all from the ground up. The previous branch, "main" will still be hosted at the same address with the commit previous to the one this update is pushed to for the time being. HoYo have their own calculator of sorts already. Other websites will have similar tools to this.**

This repo contains a calculator for Genshin Impact Character Talent and Ascension items as well as Weapon Ascensions. Data was obtained using the Genshin Impact Fandom site, the interactive map and from the game. It's still in somewhat of a work in progress, especially with the CSS. Please report any bugs using the issue tracker.
